# Consumer-sentiment-analysis
This project analyzes customer sentiment from skincare product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset includes customer feedback, and I apply VADER (NLTK) sentiment analysis to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The goal is to understand customer opinions, trends, and patterns over time.
