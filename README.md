# Consumer-sentiment-analysis
This project analyzes customer sentiment from skincare product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset includes customer feedback, and I apply VADER (NLTK) sentiment analysis to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The goal is to understand customer opinions, trends, and patterns over time.
Sentiment Analysis of Consumer Reviews
A Python-based NLP project that analyzes sentiment from Sephora skincare reviews using VADER (NLTK) and data visualization techniques. This project aims to understand consumer opinions, trends, and sentiment patterns from real-world product reviews.

# Summary
This project focuses on building an automated sentiment analysis pipeline for consumer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The process includes:
 Collecting & Cleaning Data: Handling missing values, text preprocessing.
 Sentiment Analysis: Using VADER (NLTK) to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
 Visualization: Generating charts and word clouds to observe sentiment trends.
 Data Storage: Processed data is saved for further analysis and insights.

The goal is to provide actionable insights into consumer behavior, which can help brands improve their products and services.

# Technologies & Libraries Used
 Programming Language
Python 
Libraries & Tools
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Sentiment Analysis: nltk (VADER)
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud
# Key Learnings
Text Preprocessing: Learned how to clean and prepare textual data for NLP.
Sentiment Analysis: Used VADER and explored alternative models like TextBlob.
Data Visualization: Built charts and word clouds to identify key sentiment trends.
Automating Data Handling: Developed an end-to-end pipeline for text data processing.
Scalability: Explored machine learning for more advanced sentiment classification.
 Challenges Overcome
 Handling Noisy Data: Some reviews contained irrelevant characters or missing values. We resolved this with data cleaning techniques (removing special characters, stopwords, etc.).
 Sentiment Ambiguity: Some reviews were mixed or sarcastic, making them difficult to classify. Exploring deep learning-based sentiment models helped improve accuracy.
 Large Data Processing: For thousands of reviews, optimizing pandas operations and using batch processing improved efficiency.
